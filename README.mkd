OpenXC Retro Gauge
=========================

The Retro Gauge is a mechanical vehicle gauge that outputs data from OpenXC via
serial communication. The purpose of this gauge is to display vehicle data in a
traditional automotive fashion, a gauge! The design intent was to keep the gauge
as open and accessible as possible so that the community could contribute and
benefit from the design. Below is a description of the different aspects of the
project and how the gauge was created.

For more details on the project, visit the [OpenXC
website](http://openxcplatform.com/projects/retro-gauge.html).

This repository contains:

**PCB Schematics** - The `schematics` folder contains Eagle schematics for the
gauge.

**Arduino Firmware** - The `firmware` folder contains Arduino source code to run
on the gauge.

**Enclosure 3D Model** - The `enclosure` folder contains STEP files for the 3D
printable gauge housing.

**Android App** - The `android` folder contains an OpenXC Android application
that can send various vehicle measurements to display on the gauge.
